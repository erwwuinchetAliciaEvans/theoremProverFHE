# Theorem Prover FHE: A Privacy-Preserving AI Tool for Mathematical Proofs ðŸ¤–ðŸ”’

Theorem Prover FHE is an innovative AI tool that harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to revolutionize the way mathematicians prove theorems. This pioneering platform allows users to input mathematically formulated conjectures in an encrypted form, enabling the AI to search for proofs or counterexamples within a secure, encrypted logical space.

## The Challenge: A New Era for Mathematical Research

In the ever-evolving landscape of mathematics and theoretical research, the ability to swiftly validate conjectures is critical. Traditional proof methods can be time-consuming and often expose sensitive or proprietary information. Mathematicians face the challenge of maintaining confidentiality while seeking to innovate and contribute to the field. The need for a system that can securely handle mathematical proofs without compromising data privacy is more pressing than ever.

## The FHE Solution: Security Meets Efficiency

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) offers a groundbreaking solution by allowing computations to be carried out on encrypted data. This means that the theorem proving process can be conducted entirely within a secure environment, protecting the intellectual property of researchers. By implementing Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, Theorem Prover FHE enables AI to operate on encrypted mathematical constructs, leading to accelerated discoveries in pure mathematics. The integration of FHE not only safeguards sensitive data but also enhances the efficiency and accuracy of proof validation.

## Core Features: Empowering Mathematical Inquiry

- **FHE Encryption of Mathematical Proofs**: Securely input and process conjectures in their encrypted forms.
- **AI-Assisted Proof Search**: Utilize AI algorithms to autonomously explore and validate mathematical proofs within an encrypted framework.
- **Visualization Tools**: Gain insights through our intuitive proof process visualization, making complex concepts accessible and comprehensible.
- **Customizable Theorem Descriptor Language**: Tailor theorem descriptions to fit various mathematical domains and complexity levels.
